 * According to the documentation provided at Webpack Dependency Management, this file serves as a placeholder, 
 * instructing Webpack to generate a module at the specified path. The purpose of the JavaScript file is to 
 * prevent the backend code from being loaded into the TypeScript files during the frontend build process using 
 * Create React App (CRA). 
 * 
 * The resources exported by the module are dynamically generated at runtime, utilizing the implementation of 
 * Remote Procedure Call (RPC).
